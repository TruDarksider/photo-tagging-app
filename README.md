# ~~Photo Tagging App~~ Match the Colors
Initially was going to follow a "Where's Waldo?" premise before deciding on a new approach.

Test your knowledge of Hex colors! Three random hex values are selected at the start of the page load and your objective is to find all three within the 150 slightly different hues of red, blue, and green.

## How to Play
Three random hex values from the 150 possible colors are selected and displayed at the top of the page. Clicking on a square reveals a dropdown with the three hex values. Click on a value from the dropdown to guess that value with the square you clicked. A toast will display to tell you if your guess was correct. Incorrect guesses will give you a general direction to go for your next guess, correct guesses will remove the option from the dropdown and color the value at the top with a background color that matches the value. Time will stop once the thrid value is correctly guessed.
